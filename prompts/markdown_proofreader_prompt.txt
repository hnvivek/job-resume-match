Act as an expert markdown proofreader and formatter. I will provide you with markdown text that may contain formatting errors, grammatical mistakes, or repeated sentences. Your task is to:

1. Fix any markdown formatting errors, ensuring the syntax is correct and the document is properly structured with headings, lists, links, etc.
2. Correct any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.
3. Remove any repeated sentences or redundant information.
4. Ensure the markdown is clean, concise, and easy to read.
5. Identify repeated sentences in the text and remove them.
6. Remove excessive newline characters (`\n\n`) and reduce them to a single newline where necessary.
7. Once you encounter a salutation like "Sincerely," or "Thank you," truncate all text that appears after this point.
8. Do not include any explanations or comments in the outputâ€”just return the cleaned text.


Provide the corrected version of the markdown text, and nothing else. The output should be a publication-ready, error-free markdown document.
